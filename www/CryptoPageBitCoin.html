      Analysis
  </div>
  <p class="info">With any way of getting to the internet, bitcoins which are held in a digital wallet, can be used to invest, exchange, and purchase goods as a source of currency. No personal information is needed when completing transactions, authorization is with a digital signature. The need for a third party to manage the payments is eliminated due to how Bitcoin is ran. Users part of Bitcoin authorize and prove the validity of transaction, they&rsquo;re known as miners. Transactions are verified within minutes by a network of miners who create blocks to insert the transactions. Once the miner solves the puzzle, a proof of work is required, to be then validated before recording it into the public ledger. Lastly other miners will review the transaction and verify it when checked over correctly. The process is then restarted in the same pattern.</p>
